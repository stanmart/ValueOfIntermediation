# The platform's product pricing decision

Main issue: $pi_F$ must have this specific nice hump shape in order to prove uniqueness of the equilibrium and that an increase in $N_P$ is welfare-decreasing.

## Ideas I can use
 - $V_P$ and $\mu$ are just scaling factors and $N_P$ and $V_P$ always appear together, therefore the function has essentially one parameter $\implies$ WLOG $\mu = V_F = 1$ and $\tilde V_P = N_P V_P$.
 - In terms of welfare, $N_F$ is not important, only $N_F V_F$ is relevant.
 - Is showing the necessary property for $$ \frac{\log(N_F + 1)}{\N_F} - \frac{1}{N_F + 1} $$ sufficient?
