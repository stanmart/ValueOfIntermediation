## Main ideas

 - Use the Shapley-value instead of an extensive-form bargaining model
    - Analytically more tractable
    - Has bargaining interpretation [e.g. @hart1996bargaining; @gul1989bargaining]
    - Has precedents in the IO literature [e.g. @hart1990property; @montez2007downstream]
 - Focus on the "few large players -- continuum of small players" case (oceanic games)
    - Good approximation of the finite player case even for not too many players
    - Results have a nice geometric interpretation
 - Balance generality and having useful results

## Preview of results

 - The Shapley-value seems to be a very tractable way of modeling bargaining in certain important contexts
    - One/two-sided platforms
    - Upstream-downstream setups
 - Comparative statistics give support to the bargaining interpretation
 - Extensions to include some important cases are relatively straightforward
 - Even a simple application yields interesting results about hybrid platforms

## The Shapley-value

Each player gets their expected marginal contribution

## Why do we care about it?

Same idea as with the Nash bargaining game/solution

 - Axiomatic reasoning
    - The Shapley-value is the only sharing rule that is efficient, symmetric, linear, and satisfies the null player axiom [@shapley1953additive]
 - Bargaining foundations
    - The value arises of the subgame-perfect equilibrium of various alternating-offer bargaining games [e.g. @gul1989bargaining; @winter1994demand; @hart1996bargaining; @stole1996intra; @inderst2003bargaining]
 - A tractable and sensible-looking gain-sharing rule
    - Comparative statics show that it behaves as one would expect
